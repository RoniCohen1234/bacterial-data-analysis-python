# Antibiotic Resistance Analysis

### **What is this project?**
I built this project to practice my first steps in Data Science. I took a dataset of 10,000 bacterial samples and used Python to understand how antibiotic resistance looks in the real world.

### **What I learned from the data**
* **Resistance is high:** Around 68% of the bacteria are resistant to many drugs at once (MDR/XDR).
* **The main bacteria:** E. coli is the most common bacteria found in this dataset.
* **Age doesn't change much:** I found that both young and old patients have very similar levels of resistant bacteria.
* **Some drugs still work:** Strong antibiotics like Imipenem and Colistin are still effective in most cases.

### **Tools I used**
* **Python:** I used Pandas to clean and organize the data.
* **Matplotlib:** To create the graphs and see the patterns.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** Where I wrote and ran all the code.
