Antibiotic Resistance Analysis
What is this project?
This is my first hands-on project in Data Science. I took a dataset with over 10,000 bacterial samples to see how bad the antibiotic resistance problem really is and if things like patient age actually make a difference.

Key Takeaways:
The situation is tough: 68% of the samples are MDR or XDR (highly resistant).

E. coli is everywhere: It’s the most common bacteria in the data.

Age doesn't matter: I found that young and old patients have almost the same level of resistant bacteria.

Some hope: Last-resort drugs like Imipenem and Colistin still work well, but we need to use them carefully.

Tools I used:
Python (Pandas for the heavy lifting, Matplotlib for the charts).

Jupyter Notebook for the whole process.
